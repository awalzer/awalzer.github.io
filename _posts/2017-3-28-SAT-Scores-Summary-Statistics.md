There are some intersting observations for the 2011 SAT scores dataset. Firstly, the mean Verbal Score and mean Math score are positively correlated. The better you do on the verbal, the better you'll do on the math. Interestingly the participation rate has a negative correlation with both the verbal and math scores. The more people taking the exam the lower the mean score. This becomes even more fascinating when looking at the heat maps for the different variables. The higher mean scores are concentrated in the Midwest, while their participation rates are much lower than the coastal states. This could mean that overall less students take the SATs in the Midwest, and instead it is mainly taken by more academically inclined or amibtious students who are already more likely to do well on these exams. In comparison, the coastal states have a higher participation from a range of students, meaning the mean is brought down.
